# Barley Harvest DApp â€” Features

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

- **Sensor Data Recording:**  
  Farmers can record sensor readings such as leaf coloration index, soil moisture percentage, and nitrogen content via the smart contract.

- **Harvest Prediction:**  
  The system allows entering predicted harvest dates based on sensor data and analytics.

- **Actual Harvest Recording:**  
  Farmers record actual harvest dates to compare with predictions and optimize future cycles.

- **Role-Based Access Control:**  
  Different stakeholders have specific permissions:  
  - Farmers can add/update readings and harvest data.  
  - Maltsters, exporters, breweries have read-only access to relevant data.

- **Event Emission:**  
  Key actions emit blockchain events enabling off-chain systems to notify stakeholders in real-time.

- **Data Transparency and Traceability:**  
  All sensor data and harvest records are stored on-chain for transparency across the supply chain.

## Phase 2: Supply Chain Notifications & Optimization

- **Automated Notifications:**  
  Alerts to maltsters, exporters, and breweries about upcoming harvest readiness or deviations.

- **Harvest Time Optimization:**  
  Integration of predictive analytics using sensor trends (e.g., moisture forecast) to suggest optimal harvest windows.

- **Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration:**  
  Shared dashboards and access controls tailored for each participant in the barley supply chain.

- **Mobile and Web Front-End:**  
  User-friendly interfaces for inputting data and monitoring harvest status.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

- **IoT Integration:**  
  Automatic sensor data upload from IoT devices directly to the smart contract.

- **Yield & Quality Analytics:**  
  Dashboards presenting insights correlating soil and leaf data with yield quality and quantity.

- **Incentive Mechanisms:**  
  Token rewards or penalties for meeting or missing optimal harvest criteria.

- **Historical Data & Reporting:**  
  Full on-chain history for audits and long-term trend analysis.
